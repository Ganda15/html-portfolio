 <h3>The Ballad of Narayama</h3>

 <p>The elderly are left on the mountain to die. “The Ballad of Narayama” is a Japanese film of great beauty and elegant artifice, telling a story of startling cruelty. 
    What a space it opens up between its origins in the kabuki style and its subject of starvation in a mountain village! 
    The village enforces a tradition of carrying those who have reached the age of 70 up the side of mountain and abandoning them there to die of exposure.</p>

<h3>Roman Polanski’s J’Accuse</h3>

<p>The film itself is fantastic. The Dreyfus case, which eventually exposed rank anti-Semitism in the French army and government at the turn of the nineteenth century, 
    has long been a passion project for Polanski. 
    Such things sometimes don’t work out, but in this case it has. He and co-screenwriter Robert Harris look at the case from a perspective that hasn’t been common in cinematic treatments of the past.
     Not only is this not “The Story of Emile Zola,” but Zola doesn’t even show up until 96 minutes or so into this 126-minute film.</p>

<h3>Time</h3>

<p>Anger and sorrow pulsate through Garrett Bradley’s Oscar-nominated look at the efforts Sibil Fox Richardson underwent to get her husband Robert Richardson released from prison.
     Both of them sentenced for their part in a robbery, Fox has recently been set free, but her husband is in the midst of a 60-year sentence. 
     (If that sounds like an extreme punishment, it is—especially considering that no one was hurt in the robbery.) 
     The bulk of Bradley’s film consists of nearly 20 years of footage Fox shot of her and their children—a digital record for her incarcerated husband of the time he missed. 
     “Time” is a document of pure love, Fox fighting for her husband in the face of a racist justice system. 
     We see their children grow up in that footage while Fox grows older, but their resilience in believing that Robert will get out of prison never diminishes. </p>

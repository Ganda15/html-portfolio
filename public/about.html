<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Era Ganda, and I’m currently based in Nice, France. I am a web developer with a passion for creating clean, functional, and user-friendly digital experiences. Before transitioning into tech, I spent over 20 years working in the hospitality industry, where I developed strong skills in customer service, teamwork, and operations management.</p>

<p>I hold a degree in Marketing and Management from the Netherlands, which has given me a strong foundation in business strategy and communication—skills I now apply to the world of web development. With my diverse professional background, I bring a unique perspective to every project I work on. Whether it’s building a responsive website or collaborating with clients to bring their ideas to life, I’m driven by a desire to deliver quality and value.</p>

<p>I'm currently focused on expanding my portfolio, learning new technologies, and connecting with creative professionals and clients across industries.</p>
